## Image Data Analysis

- Difference of "Image Analysis" in signal processing and in biology. 
- Workflows and algorothms
- typical workflows in biology
  - type 1
  - type 2 
- General problem of segmentation
  - beef problem
  - Signifi√© et signifiant (Saussure, General lingustics)  
- Textbook: "Bioimage Data Analysis"

## Segmentation and Filtering

- Segmentation typically has 3 steps: **preprocessing, binarize, post-processing**
- pre-processing
  - convolution in 1D, 2D (...nD)
  - smoothening
  - denoising
  - unsharp mask 
- Binarize
  - Intensity Thresholding 	
- post-segmentation filtering
  - Tuning segmented structures
  - Mathematical Morphology
    - erosion / dilation
    - distance map
    - watershed
